# useReducer Hook :
    replacement of useState hook 
    Used while Performance Optmization
    Used when u have complex multiple state logic
    i.e Used to handle multiple cases, operations at a same time

syntax : 
const [state, setState]=useState(initialState);

syntax: 
const [state, dispatch]=useReducer (reducer, initialState)

* No need to add break keywork under switch , cause it will stop execution and default happened same as per our logic 


* Additional Points:
useReducer is usually preferable to useState
when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub values.
It also lets you optimize performance
for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks


#useRef- hook 
(uncontroll component )
    Used for performance optmization
    Used to handle mutable object data like form Handling using current and Ref attribute/Property
    return mutable ref object data

    * Avoid rendering cause

    It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. ex . form handling ke time pe use karte hain 

    * It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
    
    #Does Not Cause Re-renders
    If we tried to count how many times our application renders using the useState Hook, we would be caught in an infinite loop since this Hook itself causes a re-render.
