#Why Use JSON ?
The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.
Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.


method : 

JSON.stringify() : 
    used to convert js plain obj into json format 
JSON.parse(): 
    convert json string into a normal js array obj values

API : Application Programming Interface 
bridge between server and client 

An API or Application Programming Interface is a facilitator that enables apps, databases, softwares and IoT devices to communicate with each other, without which they won't be able to interact.
It's a set of tools and protocols used by developers to build user-friendly software apps.

A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web.
A Browser API can extend the functionality of a web browser.
A Server API can extend the functionality of a web server.


#API protocol types

To use APIs, we must adhere to specific procedures. A protocol specifies the rules for API calls. 
An API call is a message sent to a server requesting an API to provide information or a service. 
Let's look at some of the most used API protocols:
    REST API
    RPC
    GraphoQL
    SOAP

create API : 

create folder inside app 

install server : npm i -g json-server@0 

to start server and create db dbile : npx json-server --watch db.json

write json file : 

Test API : postman App
