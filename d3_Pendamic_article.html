        <p>India, which has the second-largest population in the world, is suffering severely from COVID-19. By May 18th, India investigated ∼1 lakh (0.1 million) infected cases from COVID-19, and as of 11th July, the cases equaled 8 lakhs. Social distancing and lockdown rules were employed in India, which, however, had an additional impact on the economy, human living, and environment. Where a negative impact was observed for the economy and human life, the environment got a positive one. How India dealt and can potentially deal with these three factors during and post COVID-19 situation has been discussed here.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction:</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/coronavirus"> Coronaviruses</a> are enveloped <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/virus-rna"><abbr title="Ribonucleic Acid Virus">RNA viruses</abbr></a>, ranging from 60nm to 140nm in diameter with a crown-like appearance, found in mammals, particularly in humans and birds. Coronaviruses are known to have mutated and recombined behavior causing respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases. Coronavirus has a total of seven strains which include HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-19 (COVID-19 being the latest), out of which the first four had a mild impact on infected humans with mild respiratory disease, whereas the other three caused a fatal impact on humankind. Previously in 2002–03, more than 8000 people suffered and 774 died due to SARS. In 2012, attributable to MERS-CoV, 2494 persons were infected and over 858 people lost their lives worldwide, and currently, COVID-19 triggered 5,56,335 deaths infecting 216 countries worldwide (as of 11th July 2020). The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is different since it was first reported because of its mutation and recombination property.</p>

    <p>The first outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province in early Dec 2019, where several patients with viral pneumonia were found to be epidemiologically associated with the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. This market is famous for selling wildlife animals, and several non-aquatic animals such as birds and rabbits were also on sale before the outbreak. On 30<sup>th</sup> January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an outbreak, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and in Feb 2020, WHO officially named this outbreak of the disease associated with the coronavirus as COVID-19, where CO-Corona, VI-Virus, D-Disease, and 19–2019 is the year it primarily occurred. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the root cause behind COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 has a 79.6% sequence match to SARS-CoV and is 96% identical to a bat-derived Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like Coronavirus. Current assessments indicated that COVID-19 has a median incubation period of 3 days (range 0–24 days), with potential asymptomatic transmission.</p>

    <p>It took 67 days (∼7th March) to infect 1 lakh people from COVID-19, an additional 12 days (∼19th March) to infiltrate further 1 lakh, and with a third invasion taking only 4 days (∼23rd March), indicating SARS-CoV-2 to be a highly transmissive type virus. By 30<sup>th</sup> March, the number of confirmed cases had shown an exponential spike to 7.25 lakhs across the globe. The COVID-19 outbreak is the sixth PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern) following H1N1 (2009), polio (2014), Ebola (2014 in West Africa), Zika (2016), and Ebola (2019 in the Democratic Republic of Congo). India, which is the second-largest population in the world, having a rural-based and growing-urban developing economy, is also suffering severely from this COVID-19. India reached its first 1 lakh infection on 18th May 2020, and as of 11th July crossed 8.5 lakhs.</p>

    <p>COVID-19 not only killed people through virus incursion but also due to economic and mental collapse, where developing countries suffered from unemployment and hunger. India enforced 68 days of four-phased lockdown starting from 24th March to 31st May to deal with COVID-19. However, in this current scenario of the COVID-19 period, what remains unanswered is whether the virus or the hunger is prepotent in India. Thus, how India is equipped to deal with, coping with the current situation, adverse effects on the economy, human living, and environment along with various approaches undertaken to overcome this pandemic is the topic of discussion in this work.</p>

<h2>How India Dealt with the COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>

<h3>Overview of the Situation</h3>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, India faced unprecedented challenges. As of [insert date], the country reported over [insert number] confirmed cases, with a recovery rate that showcased the resilience of its healthcare system.
