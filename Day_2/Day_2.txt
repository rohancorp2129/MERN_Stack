Angular js ---- Highly coupled 

React Js ------ Loosely coupled (independent), poular to developed single page developement .

framework vs Library 

jQuery : javascript library 

AJAX : js framework , ajax is Asynchronous(non blocking object)  without reloading entire web page , it will interact with backend and frontend 

Q. can we flex AJAX request in react ----- yes

Setup React Js project 

1. we can integrete react in existing HTML file 
2. Using CDN Content Delivery Network or Local Setup
3. Through command -npm tool 
4. Single Command 


                                    npm - Node Package Manager 

commands : 
1. npm init - initilize package.json file
2. npm install - install package.json file
3. npm start - start the project
4. npm run build - build the project
5. npm run test - test the project

6. npm run eject - eject the project
7. npm run lint - lint the project
8. npm run build - build the project

Node Js - 

Process to ceate app:

create saperate folder for each app
mkdir raect_day2 First_App
cd First_App

                            npx : node package executer

npx create-react-app First_App
sol. 
npm cache clean --force 
npx create-react-app First_App

web-vitals fail -

ls

cd First_App
npm i web-vitals 

npm start

# Steps To Create Our React APP

ðŸ‘‰mkdir React_Day_2_First_APP

Virtual DOM- React Faster (Copy of regular dom)
one way binding-data flow
XSS Protection- security
SPA-Single Page Application-Performance Improve and fast result 

Testing : Jest library by react 
Routing - React router 
Mobile App - react native 
state management - redux/Mobux

why react ? 
    react has virtual DOM (Document object model) , hirarchical structure .

    data flow - uni-directional ( parent to child)
    to build single page app.
    JSX - in one file we can write hrml , css and javascript 
    virtual DOM -(copy of real dom)  faster than real DOM
    XSS protection - for security purpose 

******************************************

Babel - Is a transpiler -
JSX  convert JSX ( modern Js ) into plain Js

most popular tool of JS 
Convert es-6 features into backend .....

Disadvantages : 
    Virtual DOM - need more memory 
    Only biuld UI but cant control

(1) what is react ?
    React is a JavaScript library, developed by facebook meta in 2011 by jorden walke to build user interfaces by creating reusable UI components.


(2) WHY React?
Easy to Learn: React is relatively easy to learn, especially for developers already familiar with JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

Fast and Efficient: React's virtual DOM makes it fast and efficient, reducing the number of DOM mutations and improving performance.

Reusable Components: React's component-based architecture makes it easy to reuse code and build complex UIs.

Large Community: React has a massive community of developers, which means there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.

Cross-Platform: React can be used for web, mobile, and desktop applications, making it a versatile choice.


(3) Features of React ?

Components: React's core feature is its component-based architecture, which allows you to break down your UI into smaller, reusable pieces.

Virtual DOM: React's virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM, which improves performance and reduces the number of DOM mutations.

JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

State and Props: React's state and props system allows you to manage the state of your components and pass data between them.

Event Handling: React's event handling system allows you to respond to user interactions and update your UI accordingly.

Declarative Programming: React's declarative programming style means you describe what you want to see in your UI, rather than how to achieve it.

Server-Side Rendering: React can be used for server-side rendering, which improves SEO and reduces the initial load time of your application.
