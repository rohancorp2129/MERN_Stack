# Angular vs React

React : 
    developed by facebook/meta 
    one way binding - parent to child ( uni-direction)
    virtual dom
    JSX (javascript xml )
    stateless component
testing : jest

Angular : 
    developed by google
    two way binding - child to parent and parent to child 
testing : jasmine

MVC Architecture :
Model : data
View : UI
Controller : business logic


jsx must need container : like explained below 

If you are writing multi line code in jsx . then use this fragment

<> 
    code     
</>  

  or else 

<React.StrictMode>
            code
</React.StrictMode>

or else 

<div>
        code : but extra div will be there 
</div>


If you are writing html code , then closing tag is compalsary 
if you are applying class property to any tag . then make sure that you are using ClassName : not class  . for id no issue


for css : style={{key:value}}

<h1 style={{color:'blue'}} >Welcome to js </h1>
        for external just import file and define code in that file 

for js :
        insted of + while concating use {}

public by default import hota hain 
. To store static data we use public 

<img src="logo.png" alr="">

import/integrate bootstrap : 
        if you are using CDN then use in index.html ( from public)

        you can import it :  npm i bootstrap
